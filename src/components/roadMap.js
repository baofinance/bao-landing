        <RoadmapDesc>
          During the yield farming phase, users will earn rewards each block for staking their LP tokens in the Bao
          Finance farming protocol. During this one year period we will distribute 800 billion bao. BAO has a broad
          distribution, rewarding over 200 market assets creating the most diverse yield farming distribution in history
          so that everyone can participate with minimal risk of monopolies.

          Pandaswap, the first Bao Finance franchise, launches on Binance Smart Chain. Along with PNDA, Pandaswap
          introduced two new tokens to the BAO ecosystem - RHINO, an experimental deflationary token, and BAMBOO, which
          users receive in exchange for staking their PNDA tokens in the BambooBar. BAMBOO appreciates in value by
          collecting fees from the exchange platform.

          Soft synthetics, or nests, will be configured pools of assets where users are able to get balanced exposure to
          a basket of assets by holding one token. Nests will utilize an asset manager that will allow for complex
          strategies including lending and staking. This will be further incentivized with yield farming opportunities.
