Uniswap is an _automated liquidity protocol_ powered by a <Link to="#">constant product formula</Link>
and implemented in a system of non-upgradeable smart contracts on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain. 
It obviates the need for trusted intermediaries, prioritizing **decentralization**, **censorship resistance**, 
and **security**. Uniswap is **open-source software** licensed under the
[GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).

Ultimately, of course, the Uniswap protocol is just smart contract code running on Ethereum. To understand how they work, head over to <Link to="#">Smart Contracts</Link>.
